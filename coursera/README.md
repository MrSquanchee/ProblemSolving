# Coursera

This is a collection of my solutions to programming assignments of different courses I have taken on [coursera](https://www.coursera.org).

Mostly, the assignments are in the form of python jupyter-notebooks, which are provided by the instructors on coursera,
and are embedded with my solutions.

**NOTE** :-

I **do not** have any **ownership** for the assignments, I am just assuming if they are available for download by the students,
they are displayable by us on github.
