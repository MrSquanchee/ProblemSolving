// A javascript promise is a promise to do something, which would be usually asynchronous.
// The promise is a constructor which requires
// a function with two arguments, resolve and reject, as a parameter.

const makeServerPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    /* Define the function */
});

// resolve and reject, are the methods to determine the outcome to the promise.
